# Loan-Prediction-Application

The major problem Banks faced is customers not settling the loans in the given period.
This system will predict the customers' loan settlement plan and whether the customer can
settle the loan on time by referring to the historic data of the past customers of the bank.
The bank will keep track of all the customers who had issues paying the loans. The system
will collect and analyze the salary, interest, and loan amount of the customers. When a
new customer requests a loan, the system will collect the user's loan amount, monthly
installment, and check whether the customer can settle the loan on time. There is a different
type of customers some customers who settle the loan on time. Some will settle the loan
before the final date, some will settle after the given period. So, the system will predict
which type of customer is this and how the customer will settle the loan. The system will
also keep track of the users who have not to settle the loan. The system will also predict if
the customer can settle the loan or not by the historic data of the system.
